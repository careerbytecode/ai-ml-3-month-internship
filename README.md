# 🚀 CareerByteCode AI/ML Internship – GitHub Starter Template

Welcome to the official GitHub template for CareerByteCode Internship Projects!

This repository contains a complete `sample/` folder with a ready-made project structure. Interns can **copy this folder for each new project** and work inside this single centralized repository.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside the `sample/` Folder?

```
sample/
├── app/                 # Optional frontend apps (Streamlit/Flask)
├── data/
│   ├── raw/             # Original unprocessed datasets
│   └── processed/       # Cleaned/filtered data
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for EDA & modeling
├── outputs/
│   ├── graphs/          # Plots and result charts
│   ├── model.pkl        # Saved ML model
│   └── results.csv      # Model prediction outputs
├── src/
│   ├── data_loader.py   # Data loading and cleaning
│   ├── model.py         # ML model training and prediction
│   └── utils.py         # Helper functions
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── .gitignore           # Git exclusions
├── sample_dataset.csv   # Demo dataset

```

## ✅ How to Use This Template for Each Project

### 🔁 Step 1: Clone the Main Internship Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/careerbytecode/ai-ml-3-month-internship.git
cd ai-ml-3-month-internship
```

---

### 📂 Step 2: Copy the `sample/` Folder for Your New Project

```bash
cp -r sample/ Project1-Resume-Keyword-Extractor
cd Project1-Resume-Keyword-Extractor
```

> Always name the project folder as:
> `ProjectX-Project-Name-With-Dashes`

---

### 📝 Step 3: Customize Your New Project

- Rename `sample_notebook.ipynb` to something relevant like `resume_keyword_analysis.ipynb`
- Replace the dataset inside `data/raw/`
- Edit your Python scripts inside `src/`
- Update `README.md` (create if needed)

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 📊 Step 5: Run Your Notebook & Train Your Model

- Perform EDA in Jupyter (`notebooks/`)
- Train your model using `src/model.py`
- Save results to `outputs/`

---

### 🌐 Step 6: (Optional) Build Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

---

### 📤 Step 7: Save All Outputs

Ensure the following are present:
- Visuals in `outputs/graphs/`
- Model in `outputs/model.pkl`
- Predictions in `outputs/results.csv`

---

### 🔁 Step 8: Repeat for Next Project

For each new project:
```bash
cp -r sample/ Project2-Loan-Approval-Predictor
```
Customize, build, commit, and repeat.

---

## 🔟 Step 10: Push Each Project to the Same Central Repository

All your internship projects must be inside this single GitHub repo:  
👉 [https://github.com/careerbytecode/ai-ml-3-month-internship](https://github.com/careerbytecode/ai-ml-3-month-internship)

Each folder should look like:
```
ai-ml-3-month-internship/
├── Project1-Resume-Keyword-Extractor/
├── Project2-Loan-Approval-Predictor/
├── Project3-Student-Dropout-Predictor/
...
```

To commit your project:

```bash
# Inside the main repo
git add Project1-Resume-Keyword-Extractor/
git commit -m "Added Project 1: Resume Keyword Extractor"
git push origin main
```

> 🔄 Do **not** create separate repos for each project.  
> Everything stays inside the same internship GitHub repo.

---

## 🧠 Final Tips

- Always copy the `sample/` folder – do not overwrite it!
- Update each project’s folder name and internal code references
- Push regularly with clear messages
- Include `README.md` + outputs for every project
